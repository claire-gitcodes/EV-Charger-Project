# EV-Charger-Project

1. This project is in collaboration with CGI, Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, Nationaal Toegangspunt Mobiliteitsdata, and National Road Traffic Data Portal, aiming to determine the optimal placement of charging point locations for electronic vehicles (EVs) in the Netherlands.
2. This project analyzed and utilized a large EV charging session dataset which served as the foundation for our endeavors, created comprehensive predictive models, and developed interactive smart-service dashboards, in order to inform decision-making to our target user (i.e. Amsterdam Municipality employees) and help them define and validate EV charger locations.
